# Lloyds-Student
Team One's Lloyds Student App for CSC2022. This repositary will be where the main project files are stored, this will also be where the front end and back end is developed. The development will run seperatly in two different branches which will be merged later. The merging and branching process is relatively simple and should allow the integration of the final App to run very smoothly, and allow for both the back end and front end programmers to see exactly what each side is doing at any point.
